# RustyFileCarver

Simple File Carver written in Rust, similar to [Scalpel](https://github.com/machn1k/Scalpel-2.0 )
(but less feature complete).
Can be used to recover deleted files by scanning for the known signatures.

Features:
* Recovery from image files (`.img`/`.dd`/`.raw`)

TODO:
* Recovery from a live drive location
* FAT analysis?
